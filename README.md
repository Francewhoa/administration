### Issue Queue
If there is an issue open in _any_ of our github repositories, it’s available to be worked on. We love to see people in the issue queues, and welcome people jumping in wherever they feel comfortable. 

We try to label issues so that newcomers can quickly find tasks that match their interests. We borrowed this idea from [Girl Develop It’s issue queue](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-website/issues "girl develop it issue queue).

Here are some labels you can start with:
    - [Help Wanted](http://bit.ly/ddi-issues-help-wanted "Help Wanted Issues")
    - [Tasks](http://bit.ly/ddi-issues-task "Task Issues")
    - [Discussion Issues](http://bit.ly/ddi-issues-discussion "Discussion Issues")
    - [Feedback Needed](http://bit.ly/ddi-issues-needs-feedback "Feedback Needed")

### Teams
We have teams dedicated to working on certain issues, the website, meetings and projects.
