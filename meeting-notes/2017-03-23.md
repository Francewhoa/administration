- Welcome to the weekly DD&I chat.  You can read about DD&I's history here. https://drupaldiversity.github.io/about/  Please note that we are *not affiliated with the DA or the CWG.*
- This meeting is chat-only. There is no video or audio component. There has been some confusion about that in the past.
- Topics are posted in threads so that we can have several conversations at once and to make it easier for lurkers to jump in and out when they can.  Be careful as the notifications on this can be wonky.

If you're joining us in any capacity today, please respond to this thread and introduce yourself.

- We have many agenda items to get through, in preparation for DC Baltimore. I suspect that many of you are here to discuss Larry's recent post, and we can do that after we get business taken care of.  

# Agenda

result: we do not have an official position.


We had a long discussion, running after the meeting about
"From where I stand as a fellow track chair, he actively attempted to use his leadership position to stifle the representation of women. I don't know how that can be reduced to "thoughtcrime".

One of my entire points when I wrote Stay For The Community is that communities have values and moral compasses. Those things guide so much of what we do, even if it seems like weâ€™re just a coding group. Nothing is ever that simple, and those things will come out in real world ways (like when we try to be inclusive to trans representation in the d.o gender field, or when we decide whether or not to actively work towards diversity)
