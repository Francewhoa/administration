# General meeting notes / introduction
- Hello and welcome to the weekly Diversity Chat.  Many relevant links are in pinned messages in the channel and we'll be sharing links as appropriate throughout.
- This meeting is chat-only. There is no video or audio component.
- We will be using threads to group topics so that people who are lurking/working/lunching can drop in and out and not have a huge backlog to get through.  This doesn't trigger notifications (depending on your settings) so plz be careful.  We're still figuring things out. :)
- While we have been fairly task-based lately, we are still also here to support community members with any diversity/inclusion issues they're having.
