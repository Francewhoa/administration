Welcome to our weekly Drupal Diversity & Inclusion Group.

# Attendees
@drnikki, @amanda, @rubyji,


- This meeting is chat-only. There is no video or audio component. There has been some confusion about that in the past.
- Topics are posted in threads so that we can have several conversations at once and to make it easier for lurkers to jump in and out when they can.  Be careful as the notifications on this can be wonky.

If you're joining us in any capacity today, please respond to this thread.

How is everyone doing in the world?
