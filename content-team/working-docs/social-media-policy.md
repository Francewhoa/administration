## Purpose
*What are we attempting to achieve with our social media?*

- To cultivate a more inclusive Drupal community.
- To give recognition to the diverse voices we have.
- Transparency, public participation and collaboration

## Audience
*Who are we trying to reach?*

- For the community.
- For the volunteers who contribute to our issue queue.
- For mentors, and teachers in teh Drupal community.
- For people who organize and attend Drupal events.

## Content
*What types of content do we post? How does that content support our mission? What do our audiences want to hear?*

We want to post content that is related to diversity (age/race/gender/religion/more) and/or tech and various places where these issues cross over. Sharing content with different perspectives and difference voices allows us to learn and grow in our understanding.

We want people in the community to feel included. By being more aware of how we treat each other and being intentional about the kinds of things we post, we can demonstrate that awareness.

I also think we should look through the list of articles we’ve been compiling to read and see what should be shared, and make sure we are sharing factual resources as well - various information on diversity 101, links to sessions, presentations, articles, faqs, etc.  

## Tone
*What is the tone of our communication? What types of interactions are encouraged/discouraged?*

- We assume good intentions until proven otherwise.
- Rational
- Professional
- Knowledgeable
- Compassionate
- Considerate
- Educational

On social media, we will strive to encourage positive interactions with followers and be a compassionate voice in the community.
 We will:
- Be careful of what we like or retweet.  Like things judiciously and that apply directly to our mission. Do not “like” anything we would not tweet from the account.

In the face of negative interactions, we will consider replying with compassion versus ignoring i.e:
  - “We’d love to have you involved, how can we help?”
  - “We’re sorry you feel that way, can we better explain?”

The content team will be used as a resource to discuss whether a negative interaction should be replied to and how. Serious situations will be escalated to the Leadership team for advice.


## Personal accountability
*Do we disclose who is tweeting? Is that important if there's a unified message?*

There should be a unified message and individual feelings or ideas should not be coming in through this account. Retweets/quoted tweets can be tweeted without disclosure. Individuals should not sign composed tweets with initials.


## Dealing with Mistakes
*If there's a grammar mistake, spelling error, factual error, mis-wording, how do we effectively deal with it?*

Before posting, we should verify all content as a credible source.

For Minor grammar/spelling mistakes:
- If a spelling error or grammar mistake is caught within a few minutes of the tweet - and no one has interacted with it yet, delete it and retweet it correctly.
  - If someone points out that a tweet was deleted, indicate that a correction was needed.
- If it’s too late to delete the tweet, reply to it with the correction.

For factual errors or mis-wording:
- Depending on the severity of the error, tweet a follow up correcting the mistake or apologizing for it. Remember to be compassionate and professional.

For handling a negative situation:
- Discuss the situation with the content team and/or the leadership team to decide on the best approach to handle the situation.

## Responding to Harassment
*What steps do we take when someone is harassing the group*

How do we define harassment to the group (or it’s volunteers)?
- Comments that contain abusive, vulgar, offensive, threatening language, personal attacks of any kind, unsupported accusations, defamatory language or offensive terms that target specific individuals or groups.
- Comments that reveal personally identifiable information (PII) or personal attacks against volunteers of this group.

How do we respond to the harassment?
- Moderation and participation guidelines
- Talk within the group and leadership to discuss the situation.
- Report the harassment to Twitter
- Possibly escalate to the CWG.
